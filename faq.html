						<p class="__talawhat">Let’s get started with these basics.</p><br>
						<button class="__accordion">1.	What is Talaros?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>The word ‘Talaros’ comes from Greek mythology, as the Greek god of messages, Hermes, would wear sandals that had wings on them.</p>
						  	<p>With that in mind, Talaros is platform that connects people- those who  request for delivery of items and those who can deliver. It enables people to make money when they deliver, and to have their items delivered affordably.</p>
						  	<p>The deliverer is called “Partner”, and the requester of the service is the “VIP”</p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">2.	How does Talaros work?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>To be a Partner, register with certain details which we would need to verify for security reasons. Once verified, you become a Partner and can deliver items and make money.</p>
						  	<p>To be a VIP, send in your request and we would connect you to a Partner.</p>
						  	<p>More details on how to sign-up can be found here, including you will need to have a Whatsapp enabled phone</p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">3.	Where do the Partner and VIP meet to deliver and receive item(s)?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>We strongly recommend the following</p>
						  	<ul>
						  		<li>-Firstly, the Partner and VIP should connect on Talaros. Where both do not, we cannot provide details to security officials if anything goes wrong.</li>

						  		<li>-Secondly, the Partner and VIP should meet in or at a public location; a restaurant, a shopping mall, a public park, the airport, a bus termina, a recognized office at the reception desk. In fact, anywhere public that has people who can see you both. We recommend that you do not meet in a private location; a car, in a house, inside a room in an office and or anywhere where it is just both of you</li>
						  	</ul>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">4.	Is my payment secure?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>Our payment partner has been certified to handle and ensure all payments are secure. </p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">5.	How do I get paid?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>As a Partner, you should be paid within 1 day of you delivering an item(s). In the signup form for Partners, kindly make sure you input your correct bank account. This will be where you will receive money.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">6.	In Which currency do I receive payment?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>Payment is in Naira. </p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">7.	What if the delivered product is damaged, broken or lost?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>Prior to pickup by the Partner, it is the responsibility of the VIP to send us a picture of the item to be delivered. Likewise, upon the arrival of the Partner to pickup the item(9), the VIP should show it to the Partner. If there is damage upon pickup by the Partner, the Partner is not responsible. If there is damage after the item has been delivered, investigations will be made and if the Partner was deemed responsible, he/she will not receive payment. The payment will be given back to the VIP.</p>
						  	<p>It is therefore the responsibility of both the VIP and the Partner to ensure there is no damage prior to delivery and during delivery, respectively.</p>
						  	<p>If an item is lost after the Partner has picked up the item for delivery, the Partner shall be responsible. His or her details will be sent to law enforcement details for prosecution.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">8.	What if my order does not arrive in on-time?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>This may be due to traffic or other issues. The VIP and the Partner would have agreed on the estimated time of delivery. </p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">9.	What items are prohibited?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>We know the dark forces of the underworld always want to do something evil. All items, stated as illegal in Nigeria and the law are strongly prohibited on Talaros. It is the responsibility of the VIP to ensure the item(s) is not illegal</p>
						  	<p>If an item(s) is illegal, details of the VIP would be given to law enforcement officers of Nigeria</p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">10.	What is the vision of Talaros?</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>This is our Beta version.</p>
						  	<p>We hope this will help reduce the cost of deliveries in Nigeria, become a source of income for low income earners, increase trust and improve the trust economy in Nigeria. </p>
						</div>

						<button class="__accordion">11. Dress-code for Partners</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  	<p>We encourage you to dress as you please, while following the recommended guidelines-</p>
						  	<ul>
						  		<li>Do not sag your jeans or trousers</li>
						  		<li>No mini-skirts</li>
						  		<li>Do not dress provocatively </li>
						  		<li>Be polite and friendly </li>
						  	</ul>
						  	<p>Remember, you will be rated by the VIP and Talaros. If you continuously have a low rating, you will be warned and later removed from the platform</p>
